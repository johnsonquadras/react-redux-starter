# React Redux App

This is the starter kit for react redux with es6. Includes some sample pages created.

Sample Page. 
- Crud : Demonstrates a list of Users and CRUD operarions on it.

# Installation

 npm install
```
To start the app 

```sh
npm start
```

To run unit test in dev mode
```sh
npm run test:watch
```


# Testing
Unit test written using Mocha Chai and Enzyme.

Using JS DOM instead of browser DOM.

Using Mocha with chai prefered over JEST as JEST is slower to run the unit tests because of the default mocking.
